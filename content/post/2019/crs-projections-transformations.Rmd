# Introduction

This workbook outlines key concepts and functions related to coordinate reference systems (CRSs), map projections and transformation of geographic data from one CRS to another.
It is based on the open source book *Geocomputation with R*, and Chapter [6](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/reproj-geo-data.html) in particular.

It was originally put together for the '[CASA Summer School](https://bonnie-buyuklieva.github.io/SS_ASM19/)', or the Doctoral Summer School for Advanced Spatial Modelling:
Skills Workshop and Hackathon for it's full name, but should be of use to anyone interested in projections and CRSs in R.



# Prerequisites {-}

The solutions assume the following packages are attached (other packages will be attached when needed):

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
library(spData)
```

# Introduction

Geographic data relies on a frame of reference.
There are two main types of CRS:

- Geographic, where the frame of reference is the globe and how many degrees north or east from the position (0, 0) you are
- Projected, where the frame of reference is a flat representation of part of the Earth's surface

```{r vectorplots, fig.cap="Illustration of vector (point) data in which location of London (the red X) is represented with reference to an origin (the blue circle). The left plot represents a geographic CRS with an origin at 0Â° longitude and latitude. The right plot represents a projected CRS with an origin located in the sea west of the South West Peninsula.", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE, fig.scap="Illustration of vector (point) data."}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
  "https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/vector_lonlat.png",
  "https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/vector_projected.png"))
```

# Geographic data in R

```{r}
london_df = data.frame(name = "london", population = 1e7, lon = -0.1, lat = 51.5)
class(london_df)
london = st_as_sf(london_df, coords = c("lon", "lat"))
class(london)
st_is_longlat(london)
```
