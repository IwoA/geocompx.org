<p>TL;DR: Please help us by filling out the survey at <a href="https://forms.gle/nq9RmbxJyZXQgc948" class="uri">https://forms.gle/nq9RmbxJyZXQgc948</a>.</p>
<p>It’s been almost 3 years since the first edition of Geocomputation with R was published back in 2019.
It’s been an amazing journey for this open source book on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling since then.
We have reached almost 500k people via the website at <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/" class="uri">https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/</a> and the physical book.
The book now contributes to many university courses, lectures, and personal development as outlined at <a href="https://geocompr.github.io/guestbook/" class="uri">https://geocompr.github.io/guestbook/</a> - where you can add you own comments.</p>
<p>Building on the success of the first edition, and motivated by the need for the material to adapt as spatial ecosystem evolves, we have decided that it is time for a Second Edition.
We plan to start work on it over the next few months, aiming for publication around summer 2022.
Second edition will be available at <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/" class="uri">https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/</a>, while you can find the first edition at <a href="https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/</a>.</p>
<p>We already have plenty of changes, updates, and improvements in mind, as documented in the book’s issue tracker.
However, we want to get feedback from the community, to ensure we’re not miss something key and to find out what you most want from a 2nd edition.
<strong>We’re asking for your help in guiding the future of Geocomputation with R!</strong></p>
<p>The book is already much stronger thanks to community, with 50+ people contributing to the codebase already and many more supporting in the issue tracker and the guestbook.
<strong>Please take a few minutes to let us know your thoughts on the current edition, and suggestions for the next one using <a href="https://forms.gle/nq9RmbxJyZXQgc948">the Google form</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks from the Geocomputation with R team,</p>
<p>Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow</p>
