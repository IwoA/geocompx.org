Since September 2022, **raster** uses **terra**, not **rgdal** or **rgeos**.]\nAnother thing they have in common is that currently we have more modern alternatives to them, such as **sf** (first released in 2016) and **terra** (2020).\nFinally, the main author of **rgdal**, **maptools**, and **rgeos** is the same person -- Roger Bivand, who retired from his position at the Norwegian School of Economics in 2021.\n\nThus, given the workloads of maintaining these packages, the existence of modern alternatives, and the retirement of the main author, it was decided to retire these packages.^[More details about the context of these changes may be found in the paper by [Bivand (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10109-020-00336-0).]\n\n## How to test if your code is affected?\n\nThe most basic way to test if your code is affected by the upcoming changes is to check if you use **rgdal**, **rgeos**, and **maptools** in your scripts or as dependencies in your packages.\nIf so -- your workflows may be broken soon!\n\nThere is also a possibility that you use the **sp** package but not the affected packages. \nIn this case, you may still be touched by the changes, because the **sp** package had interacted with **rgdal** and **rgeos** in the background.\nFor example, if you run the `spTransform()` function from the **sp** package, it used the **rgdal** package in the background.\nThus, you may add the following code to your script to check if it will work in the future:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(\"sp_evolution_status\" = 2) # use sf instead of rgdal and rgeos in sp\nlibrary(sp)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you get an error, it means that your code is affected by the changes.^[But if you make the **sf** package available, `spTransform()` will use it instead of **rgdal**. Similarly, many workflows using **raster** can make **terra** available, and remove any mention of **rgdal** or **rgeos**.]\n\nThere is also another possible situation -- you are using some packages that depend on the affected packages.\nThis one is the most difficult to check, because you need to inspect the dependencies of all the packages you use.^[However, maintainers of these packages have been actively contacted with the information of both the need to act, and suggesting ways to migrate from retiring packages to **sf** or **terra**. Many packages depended on **rgdal** and **rgeos** because **raster** used to depend on them; they can safely be replaced by the use by **raster** of **terra** \"under the hood\".]\n\n## Solutions for users\n\nMy first advice would be: do yourself a favor, and just stop using the retired packages today. \nWrite your new scripts using modern alternatives, such as **sf** or **terra**.\nIn most cases they are easy to use, and you will be able to find a lot of examples and other resources online.\n\nIf you have some old scripts that use the retired packages, you have a few options and your decision should depend on your circumstances.\nIf you do not plan to use them in the future, you can just leave them as they are.\nOn the other hand, if you want to perform similar spatial operations, you should consider rewriting the scripts using modern alternatives -- see the tables below for the equivalents of the most popular functions from **rgdal**, **rgeos**, and **maptools**.\n\nYou also may have old **sp** objects that you want to use in the future.\nThen, you can convert them to the modern equivalents with functions such as `sf::st_as_sf()` or `terra::vect()`.^[Read more about this in the [Conversions between different spatial classes in R](https://geocompx.org/post/2021/spatial-classes-conversion/) and [Progress on R-spatial evolution, Apr 2023](https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/04/10/evolution3.html#conserving-sp-workflows) blog posts.]\n\nFinally, you may decide to still use the retired packages.\nYou can do that by either not updating your R installation and packages, or by creating a docker image with the old R and packages versions.\nHowever, this is generally not a good idea, because **rgdal**, **rgeos**, and **maptools** will be archived on CRAN soon, and thus you (and other people) won't be able to install them directly.^[Their installation will require downloading source packages from the CRAN package archive, and the providing the external software libraries needed to install **rgdal** and **rgeos** from source.]\n\n## Solutions for package developers\n\nLook at your package dependencies and check if you use any of the affected packages.\nIf that is the case, you need to find alternatives to them.\nIn general, there are two main alternative options^[There are also other options, such as using the **vapour** or **geos** package, but they are not discussed here.]:\n\n- **sf** package, which is a modern alternative to **rgdal** and **rgeos**, and also provides a spatial vector data representation in R. \n- **terra** package, which gives support to working with spatial vector and raster data in R.\n\nYou just need to be aware that functions in these packages are not always identical to the ones in the affected packages.\nThey may have different arguments, different defaults, expect different inputs, or return different outputs.\nFor example, **rgdal**'s `readOGR()` function returns a `Spatial*DataFrame` object, while **sf**'s `read_sf()` returns an `sf` object and **terra**'s `vect()` returns a `SpatVector` object.^[Of course, you can convert these objects back to **sp** classes and carry on as before, if you choose. However, this choice is most suited to legacy settings rather than actively maintained packages.]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|rgdal      |sf         |terra         |\n|:----------|:----------|:-------------|\n|readOGR()  |read_sf()  |vect()        |\n|writeOGR() |write_sf() |writeVector() |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe **rgeos** functions also have their equivalents in **sf** and **terra**.^[You just need to be aware that they may return different values compared to **rgeos**. For example, **sf** may use [a different algorithm to calculate the area of a polygon for data with a geographical coordinate reference system (CRS).](https://r-spatial.org/r/2020/06/17/s2.html)]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nInterestingly, the most often used **maptools** functions have been already deprecated for a long time and alternative tools for the same purposes existed, e.g., `unionSpatialPolygons()` could be replaced with `rgeos::gUnaryUnion()`, and `maptools::spRbind()` with `sp::rbind()`.\nThe table below shows their modern substitutes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|rgeos           |sf                |terra       |\n|:---------------|:-----------------|:-----------|\n|gArea()         |st_area()         |expanse()   |\n|gBuffer()       |st_buffer()       |buffer()    |\n|gCentroid()     |st_centroid()     |centroids() |\n|gDistance()     |st_distance()     |distance()  |\n|gIntersection() |st_intersection() |crop()      |\n|gIntersects()   |st_intersects()   |relate()    |\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|maptools               |sf         |terra       |\n|:----------------------|:----------|:-----------|\n|unionSpatialPolygons() |st_union() |aggregate() |\n|spRbind()              |rbind()    |rbind()     |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe **sp** package is not going to be removed from CRAN soon, but it is good to stop using it because it is no longer being actively developed.\nHere you can find some replacements for its basic functions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|sp                 |sf                     |terra            |\n|:------------------|:----------------------|:----------------|\n|bbox()             |st_bbox()              |ext()            |\n|coordinates()      |st_coordinates()       |crds()           |\n|identicalCRS()     |st_crs(x) == st_crs(y) |crs(x) == crs(y) |\n|over()             |st_intersects()        |relate()         |\n|point.in.polygon() |st_intersects()        |relate()         |\n|proj4string()      |st_crs()               |crs()            |\n|spsample()         |st_sample()            |spatSample()     |\n|spTransform()      |st_transform()         |project()        |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou also may want to visit the [comparison table](https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution/blob/main/pkgapi_230305_refs.csv) and the [migration wiki](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/wiki/Migrating) to get more complete lists of alternative functions to the ones from **rgdal**, **rgeos**, and **maptools**.\n\nAdditionally, you may still want to accept **sp** objects as inputs and return them as outputs of your functions. \nIn such case, you can use the `sf::st_as_sf()` or `terra::vect()` functions to convert **sp** objects to the modern equivalents, perform required spatial operations with **sf**/**terra**, and then convert the results back to **sp** objects with `as(x, \"Spatial\")`.\nPackages depending on **sp** would also need to add **sf** as their weak dependency.^[See the coercion section of the [Progress on R-spatial evolution, Apr 2023](https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/04/10/evolution3.html) blog post.]\n\n## More resources\n\nYou may use the [**evolution**](https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution/issues) GitHub repository to ask questions about the retirement process.\n\nTo learn more about the **rgdal**, **rgeos**, and **maptools** retirement, you can check the following resources:\n\n- [The announcement of their retirement](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2021-September/028760.html)\n- A blog post series about the retirement process: [part 1](https://r-spatial.org/r/2022/04/12/evolution.html), [part 2](https://r-spatial.org/r/2022/12/14/evolution2.html), [part 3](https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/04/10/evolution3.html), [part 4](https://r-spatial.org//r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html)\n- A video about this retirement process: <https://youtu.be/TlpjIqTPMCA>\n- Scripts converting code from the Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R 2nd edition book to run without retiring packages: <https://github.com/rsbivand/sf_asdar2ed>\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to learn more about their alternatives and how to use them, there are many resources available online:\n\n- **sf** package's [official website](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)\n- **terra** package's [documentation](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html)\n- The [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/) book\n- The [Spatial Data Science with applications in R](https://r-spatial.org/book/) book and its [section](https://r-spatial.org/book/sp-raster.html) on the retirement process\n\nBy exploring these resources, you will be able to find alternative workflows that suit your needs and continue your work with spatial data in R.\nGood luck!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank [Roger Bivand](https://fosstodon.org/@rsbivand) and [Maximilian H.K.
